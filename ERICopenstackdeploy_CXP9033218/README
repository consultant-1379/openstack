This module builds an .whl package only.
The rpm plugin is configured centrally for all ENM packages in the integration pom.

After a release version (non SNAPSHOT) is built the CI Fwk Portal needs to be updated.
This update is triggered when the following property is set to true in the pom.xml.
<publish_artifact>true</publish_artifact>

Set this property to false to temporarily disable deliveries.

# Introduction
The Openstack Deployer is a tool created to automate the manual procedure for installation of ENM on OpenStack. It is intended for continuous integration use where a fully automated deployment is required.

The Deployer aims to follow the official documented procedure as closely as possible, only deviating in cases where it is deemed necessary for CI use.

The Deployer has been tested towards ECEE and RedHat environments primarily but should also work towards other OpenStack flavours.

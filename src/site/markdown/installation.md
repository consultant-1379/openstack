# Using Docker Image as an Alternative
An alternative to installing the OpenStack Deployer package and related prerequisites, is to make use of a docker image with all of these prerequisites already performed. This image is made available on artifactory. The versions of the image will match the version of the Deployer artifact.

The list of available versions can be found at the link below.

https://arm.epk.ericsson.se/artifactory/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/docker-v2-global-local/proj_nwci/enmdeployer


## Prerequisites

### Docker
To make use of this docker image, the server must have docker installed.


## Verify Docker Container Works
To make use of the docker image, simply run the docker command below, followed by the arguments you would normally give to the script.

```bash
docker run --rm armdocker.seli.gic.ericsson.se/proj_nwci/enmdeployer:<version> <arguments>
```

eg

```bash
docker run --rm armdocker.seli.gic.ericsson.se/proj_nwci/enmdeployer --version
```

This will pull down and make use of the latest available version of the Deployer image. Just as with any docker run command, you can specify a specific version of the Deployer image to use. The example below specifically requests use of version 1.0.6 of the image

```
docker run --rm armdocker.seli.gic.ericsson.se/proj_nwci/enmdeployer:1.0.6 --version
```
